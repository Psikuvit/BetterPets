## API Usage

### Events

BetterPets provides several custom events you can listen to:

```java
@EventHandler
public void onPetLevelUp(PetLevelUpEvent event) {
    Pet pet = event.getPet();
    Player owner = event.getOwner();
    int newLevel = event.getNewLevel();
    
    // Handle pet level up
}

@EventHandler
public void onPetEquip(PetEquipEvent event) {
    Pet pet = event.getPet();
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    
    // Handle pet equipment
}
```

### Getting Player's Active Pet

```java
PlayerPetManager petManager = Main.getInstance().getPetManager();
Pet activePet = petManager.getActivePet(player);

if (activePet != null) {
    // Player has an active pet
    String petName = activePet.getName();
    int petLevel = activePet.getLevel();
}
```

### Creating Custom Abilities

```java
public class MyCustomAbility implements IAbility {
    @Override
    public void execute(Player owner) {
        // Active ability execution
    }
    
    @Override
    public void handleEvent(Event event, Player owner) {
        // Handle Bukkit events for passive abilities
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean isPassive() {
        return true; // or false for active abilities
    }
}
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Classes
- **Pet**: Main pet entity with stats, abilities, and visual representation
- **PlayerPetManager**: Manages pets for each player
- **PetLoader**: Handles loading pets from configuration files
- **DatabaseManager**: Abstracts database operations across different providers

### Design Patterns Used
- **Builder Pattern**: For constructing abilities and complex objects
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different database implementations
- **Observer Pattern**: For the event system
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating pets and abilities

## Development

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Java 21+ and Maven installed
3. Run `mvn clean package`
4. The compiled jar will be in the `target` directory

### Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Code Quality

The project follows these principles:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Null safety checks throughout
- Async operations for heavy tasks
- Proper resource cleanup

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use proper JavaDoc for public methods
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure proper error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**
- Check database credentials in config.yml
- Ensure database server is running
- Verify network connectivity

**Pet Not Spawning**
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify pet configuration files are valid
- Ensure player has sufficient permissions

**Performance Issues**
- Enable debug logging to identify bottlenecks
- Check database query performance
- Monitor memory usage with large numbers of pets

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in config.yml for detailed logging:
```yaml
debug: true
```

This will provide extensive logging information to help diagnose issues.
